# Two Player Coop Panel

This is the code for our Two Player Coop Panel project. It is based on the "Push The Button" game built and coded for the 2018 Winter ICT Game Jam. That code can be seen at the [ictGameJamWinter2018](https://github.com/chrisl8/ictGameJamWinter2018) repository.

# Description

This game is a physical game, in that it is built with an Arduino and lots of buttons and switches.
You won't really be able to play it without building something.

For my panel this code runs on a Raspberry Pi, although it works just as well on a PC. The Pi just allows me to make the project self contained.

It is inspired by the mobile game SpaceTeam.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this software locally, you will need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

### Installing

To install, simply clone the repository into a local folder

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chrisl8/TwoPlayerPanelCoopGame.git
```

### Run the program
Then run the `startGame.sh` script from the root of the repo. 

```
$ ./startGame.sh
```

It will initialize the node_modules folder on the first run.
