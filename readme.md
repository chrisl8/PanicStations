# Push The Button

This is the code for our Two Player panel project. It is based on the "Push The Button" game built and coded for the 2018 Winter ICT Game Jam. That code can be seen at the [ictGameJamWinter2018](https://github.com/chrisl8/ictGameJamWinter2018) repository.

# Description

This game is a physical game, in that it is built with an Arduino and lots of buttons and switches.
You won't really be able to play it without building something.

It is inspired by the mobile game SpaceTeam.
