# ToDo

Add pre-game menu options:

Set player count?
Set easy/normal/hard difficutly.
Set "mode" for things like:
* Not game, just push buttons for noice and lights.
* "DEMO" Mode where it just makes lights
* "ENDLESS" mode where the game never ends, you just keep doing the next thing (no timer, or failure doesn't count against you)

Adjust screen brightness and contrast (should reset to default on reboot/power cycle)

"Swap" LCD displays (and save port) if they are wrong.
